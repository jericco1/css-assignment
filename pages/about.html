<p>Hello there! I am here to tell you about CapacityBay and how they have helped me so far. When I joined CapacityBay, I had zero knowledge about coding and promgramming in general. At the time, I have always being eager to go into the Tech World and I have always fancied joining one day. The day I stumbled upon CapacityBay on Facebook has to be one of my happiest moments, because they made my search to be easy as and also moved my timeline forward; this is because I had already made up my mind to go into programming next year due to finances. I am very happy to be here becausse I have learned a lot from the company and I am proud to call here my home. CapacityBay has opened my eyes immensely to a lot of things and despite several challenges, they have alwways being patient with me and the class as a whole. I want to use this meeduim to thank the Management at CapacityBay for the positive impact that they have had in my life. I want to also thank the faculties and also our Admin for pushing me to do better. I promise not to let you people down. Thank you.</p>
